    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h2> Braxton Brophy</h2>
    <p>My name is Braxton, I'm from Utah and I'm majoring in Graphic Design. I'm taking this class because next semester they're opening up 2 new classes for the graphic design degree and this class is either required or I just think it will prepare me.</p>
    <p>My favorite past times include games of the video and board variety, drawing and writing, going to conventions and dressing up, and roller coasters and theme parks in general, I could go on forever about them, like people dream of one day traveling to Hawaii or Japan, I dream of traveling to Cedar Point, that's like my promised land, my Mecca if you will.</p>
    <p>This is my second semester at BYUI and I can't wait to see what we do in this class! </p>

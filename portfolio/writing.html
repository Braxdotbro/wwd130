        <h2>Vanquisher (Fantasy redemption story):</h2>
        <p>A prince casted out with dark magic by his younger brother comes back as an evil skeletal overlord. To reclaim his throne, he must recruit an army of evil and darkness to overthrow the now king that stole his rightful place on the throne.
            Current Status: Extremely rough first draft written.</p>
            <img src="images/vanquisher.jpg" alt="vanquisher">
            <p>Very rough sketch of 4 of the main characters. From left to right: Stonehenge, Vitus, Steamroller, and White Dwarf.</p>

        <h2>Zebra Hospital (parody of medical dramas in the style of Monty Python and Mel Brooks):</h2>
        <p>In medical school, doctors learn the saying, “when you hear hoof beats, think horses, not zebras.” But what if they’re nothing but zebras? At the zebra hospital, the licensed medical professionals cure the patients those other guys can’t fix. This series follows either an intern and their struggle to adapt to the strangest hospital ever conceived, or an experienced old doctor that’s a combination of Dr House meets Frank Drebin from Naked Gun, complete with narration.
            Current status: Conceptual stage.</p>

        <h2>Succubus Lawyer (Court room drama that takes place in modern times with Fantasy creatures and such):</h2>
        <p>She may be from the most untrustworthy species ever, but this lawyer will need to do more then roll for seduction in this courtroom. Set in a modern world where humans coexist with creatures from fantasy, folklore, and myths, the stories may be fictitious, but the cases are real!!
            Current status: Conceptual stage (writing cases is hard).</p>

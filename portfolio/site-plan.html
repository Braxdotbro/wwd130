        Content
      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        For my homepage, I’ll probably have a brief about me kind of thing. You would probably have to scroll down a bit because I don’t want to seem to egotistical by having my information and stuff about me. The information I know to include are my Instagram, my LinkedIn, and my Twitter, even though I don’t really use any of those social media accounts anymore. I would also add my emails, both my personal and my “business” email which would just be my school email.

      </ul>
      <h3>[Page 2]</h3>
      <p>
        On my first subpage, labeled graphic design, I’ll have every project I’ve worked on in my Intro to Graphic Design class, and I’m thinking of adding a little description underneath it. I also have the idea of it linking to another smaller subpage that sort of increases the size of the image and I can have the description of it on the left. I sadly don’t have a portfolio of digital art yet, I mean I barely know how my digital artboard works, but I’ll definitely have to add some things once that happens. Maybe I can even do some work before the final happens, I don’t know. I can already see myself at least doing that thing where the picture increases when you hover over it, I think that’s just called a hover function, but if it isn’t then that just shows the quality that my final website will be.

      <h3>[Page 3]</h3>
      <p>
        I’ll have 2 more pages that will have no content other then the words “Coming soon” in big letters on the page. I might just be lazy and just have it be a jpg of a bunch of cartoon construction workers or something. I’m not sure what my other categories were, now that I think about it I didn’t actually say what they would be. I think one page would be about my filmmaking which I say filmmaking but really I would just occupy it with links to my 3 film projects I worked on in high school (one of which I’m actually kind of proud of 3 years later). Then I’ll have one with my cosplay resume, cosplaying is a thing I’m pretty into but not so much that I want to make a career out of it, but hey, you never know. The last page would probably be some sort of rants and rankings blog, I’ve written a few of these about my cosplays and the theme parks I’ve been to. I had the idea of doing a ranking of every roller coaster I’ve been on but it would be kind of meaningless since no employer is going to care, you know?
